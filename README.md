# How to Finish Your Surprise

## 1. Update the Coordinates
1.  Open `script.js` in a text editor.
2.  Find line 6: `const SECRET_COORDINATES = "40.7484° N, 73.9857° W";`
3.  Change it to your car's actual location!

## 2. Push to GitHub
Since you don't have the GitHub CLI installed, you'll need to do this manually:
1.  Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
2.  Name the repository `surprise_puzzle`.
3.  Click **Create repository**.
4.  Copy the commands under "…or push an existing repository from the command line".
5.  Run them in your terminal in this folder.
    *   Example: `git remote add origin ...`
    *   Example: `git push -u origin main`

## 3. Enable GitHub Pages (To make it a website)
1.  Go to your new repository's **Settings** > **Pages**.
2.  Under **Source**, select `main` branch.
3.  Click **Save**.
4.  Wait a minute, and it will give you a link (e.g., `https://yourname.github.io/surprise_puzzle`).

## 4. Get the QR Code
Once you have that link, come back and tell me, and I'll generate the QR code for you!
